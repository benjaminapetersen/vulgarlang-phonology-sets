# Sources
I'm just an amateur, so I'm sourcing a lot of the info used to create these languages from the internet. Here are my sources.

## Ad没naic

As articles will point out, this language was unfinished by Tolkien. I've reproduced a set of all available consonant combinations from dictionaries I could find. I did not implement grammar rules, partially because they're incomplete and partially because I'm not proficient enough with the tools yet. Note that wikipedia lists phonemical consonants that are not present in available dictionaries (or I just have no idea how to pronounce them, which is more likely) so I left them out. My goal was to create settings that would create a language that sounded like Adunaic and was more easily readable. Sorry JRR.
