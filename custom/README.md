# Sources
I'm just an amateur, so I'm sourcing a lot of the info used to create these languages from the internet. Here are my sources.

## Adûnaic

As articles will point out, this language was unfinished by Tolkien. I've reproduced a set of all available consonant combinations from dictionaries I could find. I did not implement grammar rules, partially because they're incomplete and partially because I'm not proficient enough with the tools yet. Note that wikipedia lists phonemical consonants that are not present in available dictionaries (or I just have no idea how to pronounce them, which is more likely) so I left them out. My goal was to create settings that would create a language that sounded like Adunaic and was more easily readable. Sorry JRR.

## Khuzdul

This landguage is very similar to Adûnaic but was more well-documented. It is a language spoken by dwarves. There are a few sounds Tolkien specify exist in the language but there are no known examples, so to keep to available examples I've left them out.

# Quenya

This one was pretty difficult. I tried to stick to the most recent revision of the language. A lot of the spelling rules and illegal combinations are just there to make words "look" right and not for transliteration purposes. I may come back to this with a less exacting approach and just type in the transliterated consonant combinations. Again I left out legal combinations where they do not appear in the available lexicon.
